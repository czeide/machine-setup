The following are installed:

- [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [gnupg](https://www.gnupg.org/index.html)
- [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

## Quick Setup

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/czeide/machine-setup/main/install.sh | sudo bash
