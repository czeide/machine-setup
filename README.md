This script installs the necessary tools that I usually use for my developer work.

It works on the following operating systems:

- Debian / Ubuntu

The following are installed:

- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki)
- [htop](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)

## Quick Setup

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/czeide/machine-setup/main/install.sh | bash
```
